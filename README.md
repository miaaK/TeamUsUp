# TeamUsUp

This is a final project in the university. I was charged of UI design and front end development. 

### ⚡ About TeamUsUp
A web-based portal for students to:
- Review potential teammate’s strengths and weaknesses.
- Build an ideal team based on each others' specialisations.

TeamUsUp can help:
- Develop student’s portfolio for future employers.
- Encourage students to participate and excel in groups, as their profile ratings will reflect their performance.

### ⚡ Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project is to provide students with a web portal where they can review students whom they have worked with and view the reviews of other students allowing them to make better decisions when forming a group. Students will also be able to view the reviews made by others about them, allowing them to improve their abilities as a team worker. Additionally, future recruiting companies will have access to a verified teamwork history of a potential employee. With such a platform, students may be more open to the thought of trying to team up with those who they have not worked with personally before in order to expand their network as they now have access to the teamwork history of their fellow students.
